          Head Instructor: Amir Allam

          Amir went from white belt to black entirely at 10th Planet HQ in Los
          Angeles earning his black belt under Master Eddie Bravo in 2014 and his
          PhD in Geophysics from the University of Southern California in 2013. A
          professor of seismology (the study of earthquakes) at the University of
          Utah, Amir brings a cerebral academic approach to the grappling arts,
          emphasizing details and precision in his instruction. Amir is a veteran
          of EBI and ADCC and was a member of the championship-winning team
          representing 10th-Planet at Quintet 2. Amir's skillset focuses on the
          coolest-looking, flying, extreme techniques... because what is the point
          of doing anything if you don't look cool? Yes, he can pass guard and
          hold side control as well
